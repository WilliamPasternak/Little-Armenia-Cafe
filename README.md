## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations
*(optional)*
Photographer provided high quality photos that were too large for the web. I reduced image size while maintaining quality to decrease page load speed. 

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. 
Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. 
This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
